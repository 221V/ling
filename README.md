## LING on Pi

Wikipedia: -ling, an English diminutive suffix

### A serial connection 

Before you try LING on Pi you need to setup a serial console. A comprehensive guide oh how to do this can be found
[here](http://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection).

A serial console is the only means of communication supported by LING on PI now.

### How to get started?

1. Grab kernel.img from the Raspberry Pi 0 [release](https://github.com/cloudozer/ling/releases/tag/v0.3.2r).

1. Copy kernel.img to an SD card and boot your Raspberry Pi using the card.

1. After a few second you will see the Erlang prompt on the serial console.

1. Learn more about Erlang [here](http://erlang.org).

### How to build LING from sources?
